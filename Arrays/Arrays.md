## Arrays 

A collection of values each identified by an index.

* index starts at zero
* random access is possible if you know the index of the item

     ### Advantages

* random access // O(1) order time complexity 
* fast and easy to implement

     ### Disadvantages

* it is not so dynamic data structure
* it is not able to store items with different types (C++, JAVA)
